# LF Energy Governance documents

This is a testbed for developing governance documents in July/August 2019. We are following LF best practices & templates with guidance from successful existing projects like CNCF.

In short, ideas become projects in a more or less linear fashion. Later stages include more direct support from LF Energy.

<b>idea</b> -> <b>discussion</b> -> <b>SIG or workgroup</b> -> <b>Sandbox stage</b> -> <b>Incubator stage</b> -> <b>Graduated stage</b> -> <b>Emeritus stage</b>

Guide to these documents:

* [lf-energy-charter.md](lf-energy-charter.md) - legal charter for LF Energy Foundation
* [project-proposal.md](project-proposal.md) - defines proposal process for new projects
* [project-stages.md](project-stages.md) - defines project stages from Sandbox through Emeritus (based on LF template)
