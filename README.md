# LF Energy Governance documents

This is a testbed for developing governance documents in July/August 2019. We are following LF best practices & templates with guidance from successful existing projects like CNCF.

In short, ideas become projects in a more or less linear fashion. Later stages include more direct support from LF Energy.

idea -> discussion -> SIG or workgroup -> Sandbox stage -> Incubator stage -> Mature stage -> Emeritus stage

Guide to these documents:

* [lf-energy-charter.md] - legal charter for LF Energy Foundation
* [project-proposal.md] - defines proposal process for new projects
* [project-stages.md] - defines project stages from Sandbox through Emeritus (based on LF template)
