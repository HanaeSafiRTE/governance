# Project Proposal Process

**NOTE** *This is a **draft** document describing criteria for project proposals to the TAC. Needs to stay in sync with other docs & be confirmed by TAC, then we will work on creating a form that will submit this information directly to tac@lists.lfenergy.org*

For all incoming and graduating projects, the TAC is responsible for ensuring that graduation requirements have been met.

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into LF Energy. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into LF Energy and new projects to be formed within LF Energy.

Projects must be formally proposed via FIXME. Project proposals submitted to LF Energy should provide the following information to the best of their ability:

General information:

* Name of project
* Project lead
* Project sponsor organization
* Existing community: github, website, mailing lists
* Project security plan
* Link to code base
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* Statement on alignment with the mission in the LF Energy charter
* Link to *current* Code of Conduct (if one is adopted already)
* Sponsor(s) from TAC, if identified (a sponsor helps mentor projects)
* Project license 
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies, including licenses
* Release methodology and mechanics
* Names of initial committers, if different from those submitting proposal
* Briefly describe the project's leadership team and decision-making process
* Link to any documented governance practices
* Preferred maturity level (see stages below)
* List of project's official communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* Link to project's website 
* Links to social media accounts
* Existing financial sponsorship
* Infrastructure needs or requests

### Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at a TAC meeting
* The TAC may ask for changes to bring the project into better alignment with LF Energy (adding a governance document to a repository or adopting a Code of Conduct, for example).
 * The project will need to make these changes in order to progress further.
* Projects are accepted or graduated to a new stage via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TAC.
* The proposal document will be finalized as a project charter. This charter document must be included in the project's main repository.
* The TAC will determine the appropriate initial stage for the project. The project can apply for a different stage via the review process.
