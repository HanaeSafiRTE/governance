# LF Energy Sandbox Guidelines v1.0

The LF Energy Sandbox stage is the entry point for early stage projects. Sandbox projects are all under the supervison and mentorship of the LF Energy Technical Advisory Council (TAC). 

This stage has five goals:

* Encourage public visibility of experiments or other early work that can add value to the LF Energy mission 
* Build the ingredients of a successful Incubator level project
* Facilitate alignment with existing projects
* Nurture projects to the Incubator and eventually Graduated stage
* Remove possible legal and governance obstacles to adoption and contribution by ensuring all projects adhere to LF Energy legal, code of conduct, and IP Policy requirements

## What is the LF Energy Sandbox

The LF Energy Sandbox is intended to provide an avenue for technically interesting early-stage projects that are beneficial to the power systems community. Sandbox projects should be early-stage projects that the LF Energy TAC believes warrant experimentation. The Sandbox should provide a beneficial, neutral home for such projects, in order to foster collaborative development. We aspire to make the Sandbox the preferred path for early-stage projects to enter the LFE. More mature projects can continue to jump directly to incubation, but as the power systems and energy ecosystem grows, we expect to see proportionally more early-stage projects.

## Early Stage

When we say that Sandbox projects are "early stage" this covers the following examples:

* New projects that are designed to extend one or more LFE projects with functionality or increased interoperability. 
* Independent projects that fit the LFE mission and provide potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need)
* Projects commissioned or sanctioned by LF Energy, including initial code for WG collaborations, and "experimental" projects
* Any project that realistically intends to operate at the LF Energy Incubator stage in future, and wishes to lay the foundations for elevation to that stage

## Caveat Utilitor

LF Energy hopes that all early stage projects will achieve the success they desire. And the organisation will help as appropriate. But certain caveats must be stated nonetheless.

End users should treat early stage projects with care. It is expected that some Sandbox projects may fail. They may never move to the next maturity level. While many early projects are safe to try out, users must exercise their own judgment. Some projects may be alpha quality software. There is no guarantee of production readiness, users, or professional level support. Where projects enjoy the public support of one or more professional software organisations, those may be seed stage. 

## Sandbox Governance and Benefits

### Advantages of Sandbox vs non-Sandbox for new projects

LF Energy will remain fair and open to all projects no matter what their initial provenance. Should a project apply for Incubator stage, the TAC will use the same criteria regardless of origin. This means the TAC will not discriminate in favour of Sandbox projects vs. non-Sandbox projects.

Therefore the advantages of being in the Sandbox apply prior to application for Incubator, ie.:

* That a project has a legally neutral home that is stable and known
* And that a project may attain Incubation-level success faster:
* Due to public visibility and association with the LFE mission
* Through alignment with other LFE projects (if and only if desired)
* Via LF Energy Service Desk etc.
* The LF Energy will help projects adopt good principles of governance

### Neutral Home

A neutral home for your project increases the willingness of developers from other companies and independent developers to collaborate, contribute, and become committers. Neutrality requires that projects contribute their trademark to LFE so that no company is favored over any other. LF Energy ensures project governance is transparent and fair for everyone.

## Clarifying Marketing Expectations

All open source projects in some sense enjoy a level of promotion from community, user enthusiasm, sponsoring organisations and so on. Please note that in this section we discuss marketing as a measurable financial investment into LFE projects from the LFE marketing budget and staff.

LFE has and plans to invest in marketing to educate users and grow awareness about the digitalization of energy, including the purpose and benefits of open source, as a means to foster community, and to accelerate production use of projects. These investments fall into at least three types:

Developer community support: hangouts, meetups, events and (some) conferences
Digital marketing: help with online content, interactive tutorials, webinars, and social
Product marketing: conference promotion, landscape, certification, case studies, AR/PR

Since the Sandbox is for early stage, sandbox projects will receive minimal marketing support from the foundation. The Sandbox group as a whole may be promoted from time to time.

LF Energy will lean towards developer community support and the LF Energy service desk, to help discovery and initial steps towards LFE Incubation. There will only be limited LFE investment in Digital and Product marketing for individual Sandbox projects, and LFE-funded content should be factual and informative.

Some key points:

* Sandbox projects will be listed separately from other LFE projects on the website
* They will not be prominently listed at our events or issued a press release
* Project eviewed on an annual basis; submit a report to the TAC for review
* Sandbox projects can stay in the sandbox indefinitely, but are expected to create a roadmap for eventual elevation

## Entry and Exit Requirements

Sandbox requirements are summarized below. For more detailed description of criteria, see [Project Stages](https://github.com/lf-energy/governance/blob/master/project-stages.md).

### Sandbox Entry Requirements

* Require 2 TAC sponsors to enter the sandbox
* Require presentation to the TAC meeting
* Require adherence to LF Energy IP Policy (including trademark transferred) and Code of Conduct
* Require operating Technical Steering Committee (TSC) with appointed chair
* Require sandbox projects to list their sandbox status prominently on website/readme
* 2/3 majority vote from TAC

### Sandbox Exit Requirements

* Growth plan accepted by TAC
* Operating TSC with elected chair
* Used in production by 2 end users
* Ongoing flow of commits
* Community participation measurable, metrics listed in growth plan
* Used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the TAC’s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.
* Documented public description of governance
* Full due diligence by the TAC
* Final acceptance by TAC (2/3 majority)
